📜 Abstract

This thesis explores multimodal deep learning approaches for weather-type classification in autonomous systems by fusing LiDAR, radar, and RGB sensor data. A range of fusion strategies were implemented and evaluated across two distinct frameworks: one based on the 3D point cloud encoder PointPillars, and the other on the lightweight image-based EfficientNet-B0 architecture. Both early and mid-level fusion combinations were tested to assess the complementary value of spatial and semantic features.

Experiments were conducted on the Michigan State University Four Seasons (MSU-4S) dataset, which provides synchronized data from all three modalities. Among several fusion configurations, the most effective results were achieved through early fusion of LiDAR and radar features, followed by gated mid-level fusion with RGB.

PointPillars-based model: 87.77% test accuracy, macro F1 = 0.870

EfficientNet-B0-based model: 86.77% test accuracy, macro F1 = 0.8452

Insight: Gated multimodal fusion balances spatial precision and computational efficiency, offering valuable potential for real-time weather classification.
